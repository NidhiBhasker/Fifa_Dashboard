#### Focus
The focus of the layout of the dashboard is to keep it simple so users can easily interact with the data. This is done by using a neutral colour scheme, a simple layout where each area  is clearly distinguished from the next
using a different background colour. The layout also makes sure that the pie charts and one of the bar charts are all in view at the same time, this makes the interface easier to interact with as user don't have to 
excessively scroll to see the charts change.

in many different ways.
